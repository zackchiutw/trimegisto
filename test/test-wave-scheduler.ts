/**
 * Trimegisto - Wave scheduler tests
 *
 * Run: node --experimental-strip-types test-wave-scheduler.ts
 *
 * The scheduler is the driver the adversarial QA pass broke twice, so it is
 * tested directly instead of through the extension:
 *  - one wave at a time; the next only when the current one is terminal
 *  - RE-ENTRANCY: `launchAgent` drives the scheduler synchronously while the
 *    agent registers, so a nested advance must be a no-op (the production bug
 *    launched the next wave early or settled with no results)
 *  - iterative: a thousand waves must not grow the stack
 *  - a stopped/halted wave is awaited, then refuses the NEXT wave
 *  - a deferred wave (no capacity) is retried, never half-launched
 *  - NON-TERMINATION (hardening pass): a NaN / ±Infinity / fractional /
 *    negative `currentWave` is normalised at entry, written back to the
 *    caller's object, and the walk is bounded by MAX_WAVE_ITERATIONS
 *  - a `launchWave` that throws mid-wave never re-launches the same index
 *
 * The tests are MUTATION-SENSITIVE: removing the normalisation, the cap or
 * the throw-containment makes specific named checks fail (verified by
 * running against sabotaged copies of the module).
