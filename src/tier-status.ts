/**
 * Trimegisto - tier-status formatter
 *
 * Pure formatting helpers for everything the coordinator LLM reads about
 * tiers, policy and live agent state.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS SHAPED THE WAY IT IS
 * -----------------------------------
 * `before_agent_start` injects a `role:"custom"` message, and pi's
 * `convertToLlm` turns custom messages into plain `role:"user"` messages
 * with NO marker of their origin (unlike compaction/branch summaries,
 * which pi wraps in their own prefix). Before this rewrite the whole
 * orchestration policy was pushed into that user channel every turn, AFTER
 * the user's own message. Measured on a real session: 57 chars of user
 * request vs 2,103 chars of imperative orchestration text — the last thing
 * the model read before answering was a wall of "your FIRST action MUST
 * be a trimegisto batch call". A cautious model read that as injected
 * instructions with no real request attached and refused to answer.
 *
 * Three rules follow from that, and the API here enforces them:
 *
 *  1. Anything we put in front of the model that is not the user's words
 *     gets delimited with `frameExtensionContext()` so its origin is
 *     explicit and it can never be mistaken for a request.
 *  2. Stable policy belongs in the SYSTEM PROMPT (`formatSystemPolicyContent`),
 *     where it does not compete with the user channel and stays cacheable.
 *  3. The per-turn user-channel message (`formatDirectiveContent`) carries
 *     only live state that cannot live in the system prompt, and returns ""
 *     when there is nothing to report so the caller injects nothing.
 *
 * The tone is deliberately advisory, not imperative: "prefer to delegate"
 * reads as guidance; "your FIRST action MUST be" reads as a hijack.
