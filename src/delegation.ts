/**
 * Trimegisto - delegation contract
 *
 * The coordinator only delegates when the SYSTEM PROMPT makes delegation the
 * default and tells it where the capacity is. This module owns that text and
 * the deterministic, model-free analysis behind it.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * The older policy was opt-in (it said to "prefer delegating" when the request
 * decomposed). Models read that as "delegate if you happen to feel like it" and
 * did the work serially, leaving every configured slot idle. Measured symptom:
 * `trimegisto` was available, enabled and advertised, and was simply not called.
 *
 * The contract inverts the default:
 *
 *   - delegate unless the request is PROVABLY atomic (the allowlist below);
 *   - fill the configured slots before falling back to solo work;
 *   - the units stay disjoint, so "fill the slots" can never mean padding the
 *     batch with redundant work.
 *
 * `analyzeDecomposability()` is the deterministic half: it reads the RAW user
 * prompt (available on `before_agent_start`) and, when the wording itself
 * splits into parts, appends a one-line reinforcement to the system prompt for
 * that run. It is deliberately conservative — a false positive only adds a
 * sentence to the system prompt, but it must not nag on genuine one-liners.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: same input -> same output. No config, no clock, no
 * I/O, so the contract text stays cacheable and the tests are exact.
